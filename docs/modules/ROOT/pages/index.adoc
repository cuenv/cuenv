== Overview

cuenv is a next-generation build toolchain that brings type safety and powerful configuration management to application development. Built around CUE's constraint-based type system, cuenv provides a unified solution for environment management, task orchestration, and secure secret handling.

Unlike traditional build tools, cuenv leverages CUE's ability to compose and validate configuration across directory hierarchies, making it particularly well-suited for monorepos and complex project structures. With integrated Nix support, security isolation, and extensible secret management, cuenv provides a complete development environment solution.

**Perfect for:**

- Monorepos requiring consistent environment management
- Teams needing type-safe configuration  
- Projects with complex build dependencies
- Security-conscious development workflows

== Architecture Overview

cuenv consists of three main components:

**cuengine**:: 
The core CUE evaluation engine providing fast, reliable CUE processing with a Rust FFI interface.

**cuenv-core**::
The foundational library handling configuration management, task orchestration, and environment composition.

**cuenv-cli**::
The command-line interface providing user-friendly access to cuenv's capabilities.

Each component is designed for modularity and can be used independently or as part of the complete cuenv toolchain.
