The Remote backend allows `cuenv` to distribute task execution to remote worker farms that implement the [Bazel Remote Execution API v2 (REAPI)](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis).

## Configuration

To enable the remote backend, update your `env.cue` configuration:

```cue
import "github.com/cuenv/cuenv/schema"

config: backend: {
    type: "remote"
    options: {
        // The gRPC endpoint of your REAPI server
        endpoint: "grpcs://your-remote-execution-server.io"
        
        // Optional instance name
        instanceName: "default"
        
        // Optional API key (can be a secret reference)
        apiKey: schema.#OnePasswordRef & {
            ref: "op://Private/RemoteExecution/api-key"
        }
    }
}
```

## Features

- **Distributed Execution:** Run your DAG of tasks across multiple remote workers simultaneously.
- **Remote Caching:** Automatically skip execution if the results are already present in the remote Action Cache.
- **Content-Addressed Storage:** Only missing files and inputs are uploaded to the CAS, minimizing bandwidth.
- **Local Secret Resolution:** All secrets are resolved by the local `cuenv` CLI before being sent to workers, ensuring secret references never leave your machine.

## CLI Usage

You can also force the remote backend using the CLI flag:

```bash
cuenv task build --backend remote
```

## Supported Servers

Any REAPI-compatible server should work, including:
- [BuildBuddy](https://buildbuddy.io)
- [BuildBarn](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution)
- [Buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm)
- [EngFlow](https://www.engflow.com/)
