Here’s a focused review of this branch vs main and a concrete action list to reach production
readiness.

Summary of Changes vs Main

- Background hook execution with a detached “supervisor” (spawns itself via \_\_hook-supervisor).
- Approval gate for configs (~/.cuenv/approved.json) and stateful tracking (~/.cuenv/state/\*.json).
- New CLI subcommands: env load, env status, env check, allow, export, plus shell integration scripts.
- Hook state management with locking, persistence, and environment delta capture (source hooks).
- BDD tests for CLI + hook workflow; Nextest config; examples and schema updates.
- Nix flake updated; Go CUE bridge prebuilt in flake and injected for Rust builds.

Critical Blockers (fix these before merge)

- Instance vs directory hash confusion breaks status/cancel - Problem: State files and PID files are keyed by an “instance hash” (directory + config hash),
  but several code paths use a “directory hash” only. - Symptoms: - wait_for_completion uses compute_directory_hash (crates/cuenv-core/src/hooks/executor.rs). - cancel_execution reads PID at path built from directory hash. - get_execution_status compares uncanonicalized input PathBuf equality, not hashes, and
  ignores config hash. - Action: - Standardize on “instance hash” for all state/PID reads/writes. - Rename HookExecutionState.directory_hash → instance_hash to reflect real semantics and
  update all call sites. - Make wait_for_completion and cancel_execution accept config_hash and use
  compute_instance_hash. - Canonicalize path inputs consistently (env load/status/check/allow) before deriving any hash
  or comparing paths.
- Large binaries committed to repo - Files: examples/hook/target/{debug,release}/libcue_bridge.{a,h} (~67MB total). - Action: Remove these from git and add to .gitignore. The flake already builds/provides the
  bridge.
- Argument size risk spawning supervisor - Hooks and config are encoded into CLI args (--hooks <json>, --config <json>) and can exceed OS
  arg limits. - Action: Write hooks/config to temp files in the state dir (or pass a single state file key),
  then pass file paths to the supervisor. Clean up on completion.
- Supervisor detachment and portability - Current Unix “detach” is implicit; no setsid/nohup. Windows flags not set. - Action: - Unix: use CommandExt::before_exec to setsid(); consider libc::daemon(0, 0) where
  appropriate. - Windows: set DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP. - Ensure robust PID lifecycle (atomic write + unlink on exit) and stale PID detection (PID re-
  use edge cases).
- Bash hard dependency for source hook env capture - evaluate_shell_environment runs bash -c always. Not all systems have bash in PATH. - Action: Detect/fallback to sh -c (POSIX), or pick shell based on the user’s environment.
  Document requirement if you intentionally depend on bash.

High-Priority Cleanups (next)

- CLI error types are duplicated
  - Two CliErrors: one in crates/cuenv-cli/src/cli.rs, another in crates/cuenv-cli/src/errors.rs.
  - Action: Consolidate into one, remove dead code, and standardize JSON envelopes across commands.
- Status/UX correctness - execute_env_status doesn’t canonicalize path; equality checks will fail vs canonicalized state
  paths. - Action: Canonicalize, and use instance-aware status resolution by recomputing the config hash
  (like env check does).
- Quoting/escaping for exports - escape_shell_value doesn’t handle newlines and shell edge cases robustly (bash/zsh/fish/pwsh
  differ). - Action: Harden quoting per shell: - Bash/Zsh: consider $'...' for embedded newlines, properly escape ! if history expansion
  enabled. - Fish: confirm quoting of newlines/backslashes. - PowerShell: escape backtick and double-quotes correctly; consider here-strings for
  multiline.
- Self-spawned supervisor logging - Logs always go to /tmp/cuenv_supervisor\*.log, which can collide across instances. - Action: Include instance hash in log filenames; gate logging by verbosity; ensure rotation or
  size caps in future.
- Tests marked ignore and flakiness - Several #[ignore] tests; background timing uses arbitrary sleeps. - Action: Fix ignored tests (“cancellation”, “state cleanup”) and replace sleeps with condition-
  based waits (poll state files with timeouts).

Security & Safety

- Approval gate is now the sole guard for running arbitrary hooks - Action: Document (clearly) the trust model and the meaning of approval; consider optional allow-
  listing or scoped trust (per repo, per user) and expiration.
- Path validation - ApprovalManager includes path validation/canonicalization—good. Ensure all “file write” paths
  (state, approval) go through these helpers.
- Shell script evaluation - Running printed scripts (source: true) is powerful. Add a minimal “dry-run / summary” mode
  showing what variables would change to help users reason about approvals.

Technical Debt (target soon)

- Naming consistency and semantics - Rename fields and methods to reflect “instance” vs “directory”; update docs and schema comments
  (e.g., HookExecutionState.directory_hash).
- Single-run “unset” detection - Current env capture only records new/changed keys. If a source hook unsets a var within the same
  run, it won’t be captured; unsets only flow from “previous_env”. - Action: In evaluate_shell_environment, detect removed variables by comparing after vs before and
  record removes (add a “removed” set to state).
- Shell init scripts duplication - Three scripts (bash, zsh, fish) largely duplicate logic. - Action: Factor shared pieces, and unit-test script generation (assert presence of hooks/unhooks
  behaviors).
- Pedantic clippy - This branch likely introduces new pedantic warnings (long files/functions, shadowed imports). - Action: Run clippy -D warnings and address: split large files, remove redundant imports
  (std::process::Stdio at top + re-import), reduce log noise in hot paths.

Testing & CI

- Add regression tests for hash semantics - Unit tests that wait_for_completion/cancel_execution resolve the same state file the supervisor
  writes.
- Add round-trip tests for export across shells
  - Validate quoting for edge cases (newlines, quotes, dollar signs).
- BDD reliability - Move write-heavy debug artifacts out of /tmp into a per-test temp dir; de-flake by waiting on
  state conditions (not fixed sleeps).
- CI coverage
  - Ensure Nextest profile bdd runs crates/cuenv-cli/tests/bdd.rs.
  - Gate with flake jobs: clippy, fmt, nextest, cargo-audit; consider cargo-deny.

Developer Experience & Docs

- Document internal \_\_hook-supervisor
  - Explain it’s private; not a user-facing command; how args are passed; how to debug.
- Configuration/reference docs - Explain approval file location, state dir, environment variables (CUENV_STATE_DIR,
  CUENV_APPROVAL_FILE, CUENV_EXECUTABLE, CUENV_SHELL_INTEGRATION).
- Examples - Replace committed binaries with a short “how examples are run” note; rely on flake to supply
  the bridge.
- Nix flake - Confirm Rust edition 2024 is supported by toolchain used; if not, pin a toolchain version that
  supports it or back down to 2021.

Nice-to-Haves (future)

- Supervisor protocol - Consider a control socket or file-based protocol instead of PID files; add “restart/resume”
  semantics.
- Incremental hooks
  - Use inputs to skip hooks if inputs unchanged; persist per-hook hashes in state.
- Telemetry
  - Optional JSON tracing for hook timings, failures, and environment deltas for observability.

Verification Steps (when ready)

- With Nix:
  - nix develop --command cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  - nix develop --command treefmt
  - nix develop --command cargo nextest run
  - nix develop --command cargo build
- Manual smoke: - cuenv allow --path examples/hook --package examples - cuenv env load --path examples/hook --package examples - cuenv env status --path examples/hook --package examples --wait --timeout 10 - cuenv env check --path examples/hook --package examples --shell bash (verify exports contain
  hook vars) - Repeat with different configs to validate instance-hash behavior.
